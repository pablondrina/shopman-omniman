"""
Signal-driven directive dispatch with transaction safety.

Processes newly created directives via post_save signal, but defers actual
processing to transaction.on_commit() so that side effects (notifications,
payment calls, etc.) only occur after the database transaction commits.

The process_directives --watch command remains as fallback for edge cases
(worker crash, deploy gap, etc.) but is not required for normal operation.
